We live in the age of anxiety. Because being anxious can
be an uncomfortable and scary experience, we resort to
conscious or unconscious strategies that help reduce anxiety
in the moment—watching a movie or TV show, eating,
video-game playing, and overworking. In addition, smartphones
also provide a distraction any time of the day or night.
Psychological research has shown that distractions serve as
a common anxiety avoidance strategy. _________, however,
these avoidance strategies make anxiety worse in the long
run. Being anxious is like getting into quicksand—the more
you fight it, the deeper you sink. Indeed, research strongly
supports a well-known phrase that “What you resist, persists.”
