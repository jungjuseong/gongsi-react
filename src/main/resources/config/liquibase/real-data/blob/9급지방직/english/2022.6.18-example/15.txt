Christopher Nolan is an Irish writer of some renown in
the English language. Brain damaged since birth, Nolan
has had little control over the muscles of his body, even
to the extent of having difficulty in swallowing food.
He must be strapped to his wheelchair because he cannot
sit up by himself. Nolan cannot utter recognizable speech
sounds. Fortunately, though, his brain damage was such
that Nolan’s intelligence was undamaged and his hearing
was normal; as a result, he learned to understand speech
as a young child. It was only many years later, though,
after he had reached 10 years, and after he had learned
to read, that he was given a means to express his first
words. He did this by using a stick which was attached
to his head to point to letters. It was in this ‘unicorn’
manner, letter-by-letter, that he produced an entire book
of poems and short stories, <i>Dam-Burst of Dreams, while
still a teenager</i>.
