Certainly some people are born with advantages (e.g., physical
size for jockeys, height for basketball players, an “ear” for
music for musicians). Yet only dedication to mindful, deliberate
practice over many years can turn those advantages into
talents and those talents into successes. Through the same
kind of dedicated practice, people who are not born with
such advantages can develop talents that nature put a little
farther from their reach. For example, even though you may
feel that you weren’t born with a talent for math, you can
significantly increase your mathematical abilities through
mindful, deliberate practice. Or, if you consider yourself
“naturally” shy, putting in the time and effort to develop
your social skills can enable you to interact with people at
social occasions with energy, grace, and ease.
