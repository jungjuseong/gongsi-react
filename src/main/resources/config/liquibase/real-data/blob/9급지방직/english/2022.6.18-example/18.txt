Duration shares an inverse relationship with frequency.
If you see a friend frequently, then the duration of the
encounter will be shorter. Conversely, if you don’t see
your friend very often, the duration of your visit will
typically increase significantly. <dialog open>(A)</dialog> , if you see a
friend every day, the duration of your visits can be low
because you can keep up with what’s going on as events
unfold. If, however, you only see your friend twice a
year, the duration of your visits will be greater. Think
back to a time when you had dinner in a restaurant
with a friend you hadn’t seen for a long period of time.
You probably spent several hours catching up on each
other’s lives. The duration of the same dinner would be
considerably shorter if you saw the person on a regular
basis. <dialog open>(B)</dialog> , in romantic relationships the frequency
and duration are very high because couples, especially
newly minted ones, want to spend as much time with
each other as possible. The intensity of the relationship
will also be very high.
