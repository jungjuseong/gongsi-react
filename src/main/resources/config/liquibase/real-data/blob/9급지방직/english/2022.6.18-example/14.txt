The skill to have a good argument is critical in life.
But it’s one that few parents teach to their children.
① <u>We want to give kids a stable home, so we stop siblings from quarreling and we have our own arguments behind closed doors</u>.
② <u>Yet if kids never get exposed to disagreement, we may eventually limit their creativity</u>.
③ <u>Children are most creative when they are free to brainstorm with lots of praise and encouragement in a peaceful environment</u>.
④ <u>It turns out that highly creative people often grow up in families full of tension</u>.
They are not surrounded by fistfights or personal insults, but
real disagreements. When adults in their early 30s were
asked to write imaginative stories, the most creative ones
came from those whose parents had the most conflict a
quarter-century earlier.
