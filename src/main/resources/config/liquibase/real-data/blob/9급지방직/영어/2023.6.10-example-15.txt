The traditional way of making maple syrup is interesting. A
sugar maple tree produces a watery sap each spring, when
there is still lots of snow on the ground. To take the sap out
of the sugar maple tree, a farmer makes a slit in the bark
with a special knife, and puts a “tap” on the tree. Then the
farmer hangs a bucket from the tap, and the sap drips into
it. That sap is collected and boiled until a sweet syrup
remains—forty gallons of sugar maple tree “water” make one
gallon of syrup. That’s a lot of buckets, a lot of steam, and
a lot of work. Even so, most of maple syrup producers are
family farmers who collect the buckets by hand and boil the
sap into syrup themselves.
