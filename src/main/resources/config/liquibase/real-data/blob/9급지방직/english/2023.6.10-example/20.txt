How many different ways do you get information? Some
people might have six different kinds of communications to
answer—text messages, voice mails, paper documents, regular
mail, blog posts, messages on different online services. Each
of these is a type of in-box, and each must be processed on
a continuous basis. It’s an endless process, but it doesn’t
have to be exhausting or stressful. Getting your information
management down to a more manageable level and into a
productive zone starts by ____________________________. Every place you have to go to check your messages or to read
your incoming information is an in-box, and the more you
have, the harder it is to manage everything. Cut the number
of in-boxes you have down to the smallest number possible
for you still to function in the ways you need to.
