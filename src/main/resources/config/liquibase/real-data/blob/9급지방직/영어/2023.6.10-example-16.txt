I once took a course in short-story writing and during that
course a renowned editor of a leading magazine talked to our
class. ① <u>He said he could pick up any one of the dozens
of stories that came to his desk every day and after reading
a few paragraphs he could feel whether or not the author
liked people</u>. ② “<u>If the author doesn’t like people,” he said,
“people won’t like his or her stories</u>.” ③ <u>The editor kept
stressing the importance of being interested in people during
his talk on fiction writing</u>. ④<u>Thurston, a great magician, said
that every time he went on stage he said to himself, “I am
grateful because I’m successful</u>.” At the end of the talk, he
concluded, “Let me tell you again. You have to be interested
in people if you want to be a successful writer of stories.”
