In one study, done in the early 1970s when young people
tended to dress in either “hippie” or “straight” fashion,
experimenters donned hippie or straight attire and asked
college students on campus for a dime to make a phone
call. When the experimenter was dressed in the same way
as the student, the request was granted in more than
two-thirds of the instances; when the student and requester
were dissimilarly dressed, the dime was provided less than
half the time. Another experiment showed how automatic
our positive response to similar others can be. Marchers
in an antiwar demonstration were found to be more likely
to sign the petition of a similarly dressed requester and
to do so without bothering to read it first.
