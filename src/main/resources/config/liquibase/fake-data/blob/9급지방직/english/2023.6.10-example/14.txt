Dr. Roossinck and her colleagues found by chance that a virus
increased resistance to drought on a plant that is widely used
in botanical experiments. Their further experiments with a
related virus showed that was true of 15 other plant species,
too. Dr. Roossinck is now doing experiments to study another
type of virus that increases heat tolerance in a range of
plants. She hopes to extend her research to have a deeper
understanding of the advantages that different sorts of viruses
give to their hosts. That would help to support a view which
is held by an increasing number of biologists, that many
creatures rely on symbiosis, rather than being self-sufficient.
