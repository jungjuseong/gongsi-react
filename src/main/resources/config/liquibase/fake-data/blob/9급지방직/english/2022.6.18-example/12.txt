The comparison of the heart to a pump, however, is a
genuine analogy


An analogy is a figure of speech in which two things are
asserted to be alike in many respects that are quite
fundamental. Their structure, the relationships of their
parts, or the essential purposes they serve are similar,
although the two things are also greatly dissimilar. Roses
and carnations are not analogous. ( ① ) They both have
stems and leaves and may both be red in color. ( ② )
But they exhibit these qualities in the same way; they
are of the same genus. ( ③ ) These are disparate things,
but they share important qualities: mechanical apparatus,
possession of valves, ability to increase and decrease
pressures, and capacity to move fluids. ( ④ ) And the
heart and the pump exhibit these qualities in different
ways and in different contexts.
