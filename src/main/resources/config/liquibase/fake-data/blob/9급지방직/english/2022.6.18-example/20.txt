As a roller coaster climbs the first lift hill of its track,
it is building potential energy—the higher it gets above
the earth, the stronger the pull of gravity will be. When
the coaster crests the lift hill and begins its descent, its
potential energy becomes kinetic energy, or the energy
of movement. A common misperception is that a coaster
loses energy along the track. An important law of physics,
however, called the law of conservation of energy, is that
energy can never be created nor destroyed. It simply
changes from one form to another. Whenever a track
rises back uphill, the cars’ momentum—their kinetic
energy—will carry them upward, which builds potential
energy, and roller coasters repeatedly convert potential
energy to kinetic energy and back again. At the end of
a ride, coaster cars are slowed down by brake mechanisms
that create __________ between two surfaces. This motion
makes them hot, meaning kinetic energy is changed to
heat energy during braking. Riders may mistakenly think
coasters lose energy at the end of the track, but the energy
just changes to and from different forms.
