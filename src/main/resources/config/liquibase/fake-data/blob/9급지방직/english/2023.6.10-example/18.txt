The fiscal quarter just ended. Your boss comes by to ask
you how well you performed in terms of sales this quarter.
How do you describe your performance? As excellent? Good?
Terrible? ( ① ) Unlike when someone asks you about an
objective performance metric (e.g., how many dollars in sales
you brought in this quarter), how to subjectively describe
your performance is often unclear. There is no right answer.
( ② ) You are asked to subjectively describe your own
performance in school applications, in job applications, in
interviews, in performance reviews, in meetings—the list goes
on. ( ③ ) How you describe your performance is what we call
your level of self-promotion. ( ④ ) Since self-promotion is a
pervasive part of work, people who do more self-promotion
may have better chances of being hired, being promoted, and
getting a raise or a bonus.
