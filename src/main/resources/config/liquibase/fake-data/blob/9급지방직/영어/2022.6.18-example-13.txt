One of the areas where efficiency can be optimized is
the work force, through increasing individual productivity
―defined as the amount of work (products produced,
customers served) an employee handles in a given time.
In addition to making sure you have invested in the right
equipment, environment, and training to ensure optimal
performance, you can increase productivity by encouraging
staffers to put an end to a modern-day energy drain:
multitasking. Studies show it takes 25 to 40 percent
longer to get a job done when you’re simultaneously
trying to work on other projects. To be more productive,
says Andrew Deutscher, vice president of business
development at consulting firm The Energy Project,
“do one thing, uninterrupted, for a sustained period of time.”
