In many Catholic countries, children are often named
after saints; in fact, some priests will not allow parents
to name their children after soap opera stars or football
players. Protestant countries tend to be more free about
this; however, in Norway, certain names such as Adolf
are banned completely. In countries where infant mortality
is very high, such as in Africa, tribes only name their
children when they reach five years old, the age in which
their chances of survival begin to increase. Until that time,
they are referred to by the number of years they are.
Many nations in the Far East give their children a unique
name which in some way describes the circumstances
of the child’s birth or the parents’ expectations and hopes
for the child. Some Australian aborigines can keep
changing their name throughout their life as the result of
some important experience which has in some way proved
their wisdom, creativity or determination. For example,
if one day, one of them dances extremely well, he or she
may decide to re-name him/herself ‘supreme dancer’ or
‘light feet’.
